# Projects 
Full Stack Software Development - Android Gallery App • Rutgers University 
Designed and Developed application for Windows and Android to store photos with date and tags throughout many albums with user friendly interface and features to add, search, edit, delete, and move. 

Minesweeper – Interference-Informed Action • Rutgers University 
Overcame artificial intelligence agents operating in the world by proving that data collection and inference can inform future action and future data collection. Successfully established the importance of formulation and representation through data-driven solution development. 

Network Communication • Rutgers University 
Created a server program in C that accepts HTTP requests and allows multiple clients to message each other.

Cache Simulator – Computer Architecture • Rutgers University  
Developed a cache simulator using C that provide real program memory traces as input in the cache simulator. All programs were run on Linux machines to ensure functionality.

Blackjack Game - Python Object Oriented Program
Develop a blackjack game in python, basic game functionality, to demonstrate object oriented programming in python. User can view current hand, hit, deal a new hand, shuffle a new deck, and view discarded deck.

Search and Destroy - Artificial intelligence • Rutgers University
we explore the idea of modeling knowledge/belief about a system probabilistically, and use this
belief state to efficiently direct future action. We created a random Maze which has different "terrains" making it harder for the agent to find its target. The Agent updates known information after searching each cell, and increases its criteria of probability for searching on a given terrain. 

Cannon projectiles - Graphics and Physics • Rutgers University.
Simulating and animating the effect of two cannons shooting, by recreating the cannon balls trajectory by manipulating their velocity, gravity and dt. Accounting for collitions and other objects in the created environment. 

Maze Game - Graphics • Rutgers University.
Recreating the classic maze game and animating it using using threejs in javascript. User can play using keypad and reach the exit. Using a random maze generator, we generate a maze especified by the player's dimension, then using  the DFS algorithm, we ensure there's an exit before loading the created maze for the user. 

Knoch Snowflake - Graphics • Rutgers University.
Recreates a knoch snowflake by manipulating line segments using line segment rule. using threejs.
